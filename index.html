        <h2>Luis Rosado, Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Hello! I'm Luis Rosado, a dedicated and ambitious student on a mission to build a successful career as a software engineer. As a coding enthusiast, I am passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. </p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Education has always been a priority for me, and I am currently pursuing a Coding Certification from the University of California, Irvine. My academic journey has also included studying Sociology and Psychology at the University of California, Riverside, where I maintained a GPA of 3.3. Before that, I earned Associate Degrees in Social and Behavioral Sciences and Psychology from East Los Angeles College, graduating with a GPA of 3.7 in both areas. </p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Throughout my professional life, I've been fortunate to have gained valuable experience in customer service and management roles. As a Store Manager at Chrono Toys, I honed my skills in operational management, team leadership, and strategic decision-making. I'm proud of my contribution to making it the highest-grossing store in the company. While working as an AT&T Account Manager at Best Buy, I developed a strong understanding of telecommunication services, excellent customer handling, and conflict resolution abilities.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">My journey in the retail industry continued with roles as a Lead Retail Sales Associate and Store Manager at Sprint, where I excelled in providing exceptional customer experiences, managing financial transactions, and driving sales growth. These experiences have not only strengthened my interpersonal skills but also taught me the value of teamwork and adaptability.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Despite my successes in the retail industry, my true passion lies in coding and programming. My dedication to continuous learning has led me to explore various coding languages and frameworks independently. I have worked on personal coding projects to deepen my knowledge and showcase my programming abilities.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Now, I am eager to bring my passion for coding and my diverse skill set into a rewarding role as a software engineer. I am confident in my ability to apply my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and strong work ethic to create innovative and efficient solutions.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">As I progress through my coding course and expand my programming expertise, I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills to a dynamic and forward-thinking company. I am open to challenges and believe in the power of collaboration to achieve remarkable outcomes.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I am looking forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my coding abilities and commitment to excellence to potential job recruiters in the software engineering field. If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out via email at Andypanther1@gmail.com or phone at (213)-840-7185.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">Let's build a better future through technology together!</p>
